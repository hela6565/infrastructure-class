== Overview
Telemetry plays a key role in every Devops organization. Teams rely on telemetry collection and analysis as a feedback mechanism to understand how a service is performing. As teams deploy code changes to a service, metrics allow teams to understand how these changes are impacting the service. 

Nearly every modern application generates a set of application log data which describes application events and failures. Engineers review application logs when trying to diagnose service problems. In this week's project we will utilize a common ELK stack architecture to ingest and analyze log information from a server.
